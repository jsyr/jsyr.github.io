<b>About me:</b></span></p>



<p ><span lang=EN-US >I

am currently a senior Computer Systems <a href="http://www.iti.gr">Researcher at Center for Research and Technology, Hellas (CERTH)</a> 
working in the area Novel Architectures for Cloud computing, where i
primarily design and develop systems solutions (currently working on
 Virtualization support, Orchestration tools, Software Defined Networks and H/w S/w 
 Co-design).<b>I love building things that work!</b> and most of my publication record is 
 about novel system implementations. At CERTH, i collaborate with the team of <a
href="http://www.inf.uth.gr/~leandros">Professor Leandros Tassiulas </a>. 
I received my Phd from University of Thessaly in 2009 under the supervision of  <a href="http://www.inf.uth.gr/~lalis">
Professor Spyros Lalis</a>.</p>

<p><b>Hands-on Expertise:</b></p>



<p>

<b> Phd focus: </b>
<br><br>

During my Phd have focused on Systems
Middleware(for OS core, Network I/O, Low-level Graphics) and Computer
Architecture technologies. As a senior researcher i have focused on Virtualization Technologies and High 
Performance Networking systems. 

<br><br>
<b> Linux Kernel and System V:</b>
<br><br>

I have worked extensively in the linux kernel, i am fairly experienced with the internals, have done lots of
System V programming and i closely follow its evolution to date. Regarding the kernel i have solid understanding 
of the overall kernel core organization, have hacked various subsystems of the network stack (down to the drivers),
have worked on architecture framework interface to support platform variants and scheduler interface. Currently i
work on a project that requires changes to the memory subsystem and NUMA extensions. I have a experience with common
design practices and i am using the available facilities for memory allocation and virtualization, thread syncronization
etc with consciense.   
<br><br>
<b> Hardware/Software Co-design: </b>
<br><br>
I have also worked on hardware-software co-design approaches where i developed full-fledged gateware 
systems (from simulation to deployment). I have used a variety of FPGA platforms but primarily the very popular 
netFPGA (main focus was on network acceleration).

<br><br>
<b> Virtualization Systems: </b>
<br><br>
Regarding compute virtualization i have mostly focussed on Software-defined Networking, Xen Internals and 
QEMU hypervisor. I have a good understanding on how things work, and what are the tradeoffs of the approaches. 
My focus on relevant projects is on interconnect and network architectures and relates to improving 
communication latency or performance or take optimal advantage of what is available. 

<br><br>
<b> System Administration: </b>
<br><br>
From 2000-2008, i have build from scratch and administered three different experimental clusters and one 
commercial (company that was running fluent simulator). I have also coded some problems using MPI back then. 
In 2015 i have participated in the initial development efforts of the Centaurus Datacenter which is based on HP Gen9 platforms. There i have installed, 
configured and made several changes to Openstack compute.     
<br><br>
<b> Development tools: </b>
<br><br>
I feel at home with eclipse, git, gdb and valgrind. I have coded mostly in C, C++ and Python. Python with C is my 
favourite combination - and i have successfully used it in many projects. Bash scripting is something i also oftenly use.
Have also worked with Java, Javascript(front-ends), Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and know my way around Scala. 

I am following closely the evolution of development tools for large scale software development,
i am open to new approaches and have a broad overview of what is available, what are the main tradeoffs (mainly
rapid development vs Performance) and have experience in selecting the right tool for each job. </p>

<p ><b>Other:</b></p>



<p>
      Engaged in stamina-related sports(both mentally and physically): Marathons, 
      Sport Rock Climbing (mostly 1-2 pitches, but have done a few 200M+ routes 
      at <a href="http://www.climb-europe.com/RockClimbingGreece/Meteora.htm">Meteora</a>), 
      Multi-day (several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivouac_sack">bivouacs</a>!)

      and Ski Mountaineering (races too!). Big fan of sports tourism, i spend 15 days at
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamonix">Chamonix Mt Blanc</a> each summer the last years

<h3>Notable Open Source Contributions</h3>



<p><b>BlackAdder Network Node System</b></p>

<p>An alternative fully functional linux kernel network stack architecture for the Internet.
Contributed to several subsystems. </p>

<p>The design is documented in this Paper: <b>G. Parisis, D. Trossen
and D. Syrivelis</b>, Implementation and evaluation
of an information-centric network, <i>IFIP Networking 2013</i> (Presented Core System of the Pursuit project which won 2013 <a href="http://www.fp7-pursuit.eu/PursuitWeb/?p=967">FIA award</a>) </p>


<p><b>IPsec support for the MIT Click modular router project</b></p>

<p>In this work i have added IPsec support to the MIT Click Modular Router
Project.  The implementation and how-to can be found in Click-Wiki. This work was
a result of my collaboration with  Princeton University.</p>



<p><b>Volatile Software Suspend for uClinux kernel</b></p>


<p>In this work, i have developed a custom, first stage loader assisted,
suspend-resume scheme for uClinux kernel. The system suspends execution by storing the H/w 
state in volatile memory. The overall process is extremely fast and the kernel is able to 
resume execution on adifferent H/w platform. On reconfigurable hardware platforms this is indeed 
useful. This work is backed up by a USENIX Annual Technical Conference Publication.</p>


<p><b>Porting the Blob bootloader
and linux kernel to NMI uEngine
platform</b></p>
This work is now outdated because the
hardware platform is outdated. It was done back in 2003 for the IST project
2WEAR. Patches have been integrated to the 2.4 series
mainline Arm linux kernel.</p>
